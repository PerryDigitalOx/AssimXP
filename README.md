# AssimXP
Assimilation done in Blitz Basic

This project requires owning [Blitz Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitz_BASIC). 

This code can be used for any use, private, public, commercial, educational, etc. as long as you don't sell it or take ownership of the code or end product made from any of the code.

I created the original game in DOS in 1992.  This version was made in 2003.
This version I created to learn Blitz Basic.  This is my 1st project in Blitz.  
The reason why the code is not the best it could be is I tried to stick to the 
original code.  I cut and paste function by function converting from C to Blitz.  
Restrictions I had to work around were having a structure with 2d array inside,
which blitz can't do.  
The AI had to be redone from scratch.  
  
If you use, enjoy, learn, whatever, from this game/code, please drop me a line.
